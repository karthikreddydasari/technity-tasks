I haven't completed the entire part of the task.
I installed the given packages and ran the bot.
Created my own bot using botfather and got bot-id & key placed in environment variables and ran bot.py.
As of now, only the following will run.
The bot can only understand the input '/start', '/stop', '/help', and anything other than these commands will give output that it didn't understand.
