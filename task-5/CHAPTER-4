9.  The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *
10. append() adds the element at last index position in the list
    whereas inser() can adds the element at anywhere in the list
11.  The del statement is good to use when you know the index of the value you want to remove from the list.
     The remove() method is useful when you know the value you want to remove from the list

      The deepcopy() function will copy these inner lists as well.
