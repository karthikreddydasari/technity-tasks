1.   A major purpose of functions is to group code that gets executed multiple times. 
     Without a function defined, you would have to copy and paste this code each time.
     Functions reduce the need for duplicate code.
     It also makes debugging your code easier as you already know where that part of program is defined, so you won't have to go through the full code.
2.   If the function is called
3.   def functionname(arguments)
4.   A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.
     A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the functionâ€™s return value.
5.   There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.
6.   When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.
7.   A return value is the value or expression that the function should return
     return value can be used as part of an expression.
8.   Return value is None.
9.   A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable
10.  The datatype of None value is "NoneType"
11.  That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic
12.  spam.bacon()
13.  Errors can be handled with try and except statements. 
     The code that could potentially have an error is put in a try clause.
14.  The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.
     The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.
