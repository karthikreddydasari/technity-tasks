1. Hi, My name is DASARI KARTHIK REDDY from CSE. Coming to my academics I have always been in the front row and
   curious to learn about new things. I have received many awards and prizes from organizations/schools in essay, elocution, and
     quiz competitions. I have also grabbed third prize in the quiz session of the AWS beginner course conducted at Anokha Fest 
     and third prize from Quiz Competition conducted by Rama Chandra Kalluri. I'm a very joyful person and can easily mingle with others. I will never take the actions/work as a burden and
     am very excited to contribute to the club.

2. 
    I will(somewhat) plan things a little bit ahead of everything. So, I have learned HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and C language and am currently learning Python. By the end of sem, I would like to learn Java, C++, and SQL as they are my course academics. I have an interest in learning advanced JavaScript and React. 

3.   I can contribute to the club in many ways. I really liked the programs conducted by the club last semester and I'm very much excited to give my side effort for the club. I can give my support full-time whenever needed to the club. I will participate and volunteer in the conducted programs or  events. Also, I can learn things quickly and I will give my vision/ thoughts that will benefit and growth for the club. I would like to do the given tasks or anything in an innovative or creative way that will be unique and can be easily differentiated from who really i am Also I have some prior experience & knowledge in the past. I look forward to establishing friendships with mates and I believe my skills and knowledge will help you to find way for the benefit of the club.

4.   The practical round and as you mentioned there will be a technical round for the selection process. I think it'll be sufficient for the selection process.
